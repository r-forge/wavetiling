1) mail Benilton Carvalho to make available pmStrand for TilingFeatureSet
2) split function wfm.analysis in part for fitting with normalized estimated effect functions and part for inference for specific contrasts
3) wfm.analysis: merge arguments "method" and "design.matrix" to "design". If character then use preprogrammed code, if matrix use custom design matrix
4) plot function: create argument contrasts to plot specific contrasts
5) wfm.analysis,WaveTilingFeatureSet-method: check calculation of confidence intervals
6) wfm.analysis,WaveTilingFeatureSet-method: check implementation of "two.sided" (adapt according to SAGMB paper)
7) plotWfm,Wfm-method: introduce option to give groupnames to put on Y-axis of plot
8) getNonAnnotatedRegions,Wfm-method: make function more generic wrt how the strands and features in the annotation file are defined
9) getNonAnnotatedRegions,Wfm-method: include option to give max./mean expression / FC per region
10) getNonAnnotatedRegions,Wfm-method: add option to set threshold for minimum density of probes within the regions
11) getSigGenes,Wfm-method: add option to include thresholds (density, outliers,...)
12) getSigGenes,Wfm-method: add option to also detect regions that don't overlap but are in the neighbourhood of annotated regions
13) getSigGenes,Wfm-method: add option to include mean / max expression / FC for each gene
