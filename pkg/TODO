KDB:
1) wfm.analysis,waveTilingFeatureSet-method: check calculation of confidence intervals
2) wfm.analysis,waveTilingFeatureSet-method: check implementation of "two.sided" (adapt according to SAGMB paper)
3) plotWfm,Wfm-method: introduce option to give groupnames to put on Y-axis of plot
4) getNonAnnotatedRegions,Wfm-method: make function more generic wrt how the strands and features in the annotation file are defined
5) getNonAnnotatedRegions,Wfm-method: include option to give max./mean expression / FC per region
6) getNonAnnotatedRegions,Wfm-method: add option to set threshold for minimum density of probes within the regions
7) getSigGenes,Wfm-method: add option to include thresholds (density, outliers,...)
8) getSigGenes,Wfm-method: add option to also detect regions that don't overlap but are in the neighbourhood of annotated regions
9) getSigGenes,Wfm-method: add option to include mean / max expression / FC for each gene
