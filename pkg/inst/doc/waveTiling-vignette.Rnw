% ---- This is just a stub. -----
% The real .Rnw source for this vignette is in inst/scripts/waveTiling.Rnw
% It cannot be put here (inst/doc/) since it takes too much time and memory to run.
% So it needs to be run manually, and the resulting PDF is distributed as part 
% of the source package. See the 'Makefile' in this directory, which will 
% copy the PDF from ../scripts to here.
